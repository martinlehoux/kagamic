## TODO

- Testing setup
- Vec_get not safe, I made a type mistake. And should be more efficient for loops
- Fix tests in release
- Benchmark 100MB file
  - json.loads: 526 ms ± 77 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
- Vec_new returns pointer
- More modern include pragma (once)
- File structure
- Static functions for private?
- JSON float
