## TODO

- Testing setup
- Vec push no need to reallocate vec, only items. Same for Str? Read about stack pointers in C
- Vec_get not safe, I made a type mistake. And should be more efficient for loops
- Fix tests in release
- Benchmark 1MB file
- More modern include pragma (once)
- File structure
- Ignore some errors
